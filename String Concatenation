We have covered a lot of built-in functionality in Java throughout this lesson. Weâ€™ve seen +, -, <, ==, and many other operators. 
Most of these only work on primitives, but some work on Strings too!

String username = "PrinceNelson";
System.out.println("Your username is: " + username);

##This code will print:##

Your username is: PrinceNelson



public class Zoo {
  	public static void main(String[] args){
      int animals = 12;
      String species = "zebra";

      String zooDescription = "Our zoo has " + animals + " " + species + "s!";

      System.out.println(zooDescription);
    }       
}

**Our zoo has 12 zebras!**
